# 1brc

These are solutions to the [1 Billion Row Challenge](https://1brc.dev/).

A script generates 1 billion tagged measurements. The challenge is to read
those measurements and print out a summary of the measurements,
sorted by tag in alphabetical order, where each line contains the minimum,
average, and maximum of the measurements for a tag.
